# Archaeological-data

The data in this repository were compiled within the framework of the *Finding the Limits of the Limes* project [(Verhagen *et al.* 2019)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-04576-0) from publicly available datasets and literature, in particular through [ARCHIS](https://archis.cultureelerfgoed.nl) and [DANS Easy](https://easy.dans.knaw.nl). In order to harmonize the data, the ARCHIS2 database structure was used, which distinguishes between individual finds and observations, and uses standardized vocabularies for chronology and find types. A description of the ARCHIS2 database structure is added, since there is no public domain resource available for this anymore.

The registered observations were grouped into archaeological sites when 10 or more Roman period finds were reported within a 250 m radius. The sites were then classified into functional groups. The large majority of observed sites was classified as "rural settlement", and this is the data that was used for the analysis presented in this paper. However, various other categories were distinguished, including cemeteries, cult sites, infrastructure, civil settlements and military forts.
